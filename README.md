# Topic-Modeliing-and-Sentiment-Analysis-of-STT-Tweets

This repo has the codes to perform sentiment analysis and topic modelling on the tweets of Stop the traffick's golbal handle - @STOPTHETRAFFIK. The analysis and data created in this repo is to act as supplementary to the work done in main repo  -> https://github.com/noeljbasil/mstt-twtr

I have used state of the art Bertopic to perform topic modelling. The details of this model can be found in the original repo -> https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic

Sentiment analysis was performed using vader.
